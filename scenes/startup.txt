*comment --- PLAYER SETUP ---

Your week begins before it even starts—on a quiet Sunday night, staring at a calendar that doesn’t care about how anyone’s body actually works.

A prototype is due in seven days.

A team depends on you.

As you stare at the blue email screen, your eyes drift toward your last sent email and your name written under it…

    #Choose my name.
        *input_text player_name

[i]Well, no use overthinking it now,[/i] you think.

*page_break A New Week Approaches

It’s late. The building’s glass windows mirror back an image of someone already thinking a day too far ahead.

You’ve led projects before, but this one carries weight:  
A prototype that determines the company’s next quarter—and maybe your team’s future funding.

Tomorrow begins the sprint.

But before sleep claims you, one thought gnaws at your mind:

[i]How do I structure the week?[/i]

The calendar offers several approaches, and each one quietly leans toward a different kind of daily rhythm.

*choice
    #A strict early-morning structure for everyone. (Daily 8am syncs, heavy planning before noon.)
        *set rhythm_lark %+40
        *goto intro2

    #A late-start schedule that accommodates deep-night productivity. (Flexible mornings, major work after sunset.)
        *set rhythm_owl %+40
        *goto intro2

    #A balanced schedule with predictable cycles and regular breaks. (Midday checkpoints, stable pacing.)
        *set rhythm_third %+40
        *goto intro2


*label intro2
You finalize your plan and close the laptop.  
The week hasn’t begun, yet something tells you the calendar alone won’t be enough.
